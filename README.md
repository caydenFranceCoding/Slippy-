Hello! I am Cayden France, the owner and the creator of Slippy. Slippy is an ai powered
web-based IDE. You can code in html, JavaScript, and CSS while having the power of ai at
your fingertips. I am currently a computer science undergrad. I am still learning and
building web applications and websites. Slippy is nowhere close to finished, I started it as a
project with my friends to see who could build and deploy one of the fastest ai powered
web apps and this is my product. I am extremely proud of what I have created, and I do plan
on updating and adding onto this application. Thank you all for your support and
acknowledgment of this project being a work in progress. Happy coding
